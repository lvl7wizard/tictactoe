# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game built with JavaScript and React. This classic game is designed for 2 players to engage in the timeless (and seemingly endless) battle between naughts and crosses.

## Features
- 2-Player Mode: Compete against a friend in real-time.
- Responsive Design: Play on any device with ease.
- Simple Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for a smooth gaming experience.

## How to Play
- Visit the live version of the game.
- Choose a square to place your mark (either X or O).
- The first player to form a line of three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- If the board fills up before any player achieves a line, the game ends in a draw.

## Live Demo
- You can try out the game live [here](https://tictactoedj.netlify.app/).
